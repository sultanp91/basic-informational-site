The task here is to make a simple website using Node. Here are the project instructions:

1.  Make a project directory and create the following files inside that directory:
    - index.html
    - about.html
    - contact-me.html
    - 404.html
2.  Create your node.js server file `index.js` and add the code needed to serve the right page according to the url.
    - [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) should take users to index.html
    - [localhost:8080/about](http://localhost:8080/about) should take users to about.html
    - [localhost:8080/contact-me](http://localhost:8080/contact-me) should take users to contact-me.html
    - 404.html should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.
